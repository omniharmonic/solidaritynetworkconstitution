# [Organization Name] Constitution

## Overview

This constitution establishes the foundational governance framework for [Organization Name]. It defines our identity, structure, and protocols for collective decision-making and action.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Begin with Identity** (Section 1): Define your organization's core purpose, vision, and values
2. **Design Structure** (Section 2): Create roles, membranes, and assets that support your identity
3. **Establish Protocols** (Section 3): Develop processes for governance and operations
4. **Use Templates** (Section 0): Leverage provided templates for proposals and documentation

## Constitution Structure

### 1. Identity
The core meaning and intentionality of your organization â€” why it exists, what it serves, and how it stays oriented over time.

- **Vision**: The world you seek to help create
- **Purpose**: Why you exist now
- **Mission**: What you do to fulfill your purpose
- **Worldview**: Your fundamental assumptions about how the world works
- **Mandates**: What you are obligated to do
- **Values**: What you stand for (personal and system design ethics)
- **Pledge**: What members commit to when joining

### 2. Structure
The organizational architecture that supports your identity and enables effective governance.

- **Roles**: Defined positions with specific rights and responsibilities
- **Membranes**: Organizational units or "circles" for different functions
- **Assets**: Resources, tools, and information managed by the organization

### 3. Protocols
Formalized processes and procedures for governance, operations, and interactions.

- **Role Protocols**: Processes for managing roles (add, remove, elect, assign)
- **Membrane Protocols**: Processes for organizational operations
- **Asset Protocols**: Processes for managing resources and information

### 0. Meta
Supporting materials and templates for effective implementation.

- **Templates**: Standardized formats for proposals and documentation
- **Guides**: Instructions for using the constitution effectively

## Implementation Instructions

### Phase 1: Identity Development (2-3 weeks)
1. Use the Identity Section Dialogue Survey to guide group discussions
2. Draft each identity document with your group
3. Review and refine until consensus is reached
4. Ensure all identity documents align with each other

### Phase 2: Structure Design (3-4 weeks)
1. Identify the core functions your organization needs to fulfill
2. Design roles that support these functions
3. Create membranes (organizational units) that group related roles
4. Define assets that support your operations
5. Ensure structure supports your identity and mission

### Phase 3: Protocol Development (4-6 weeks)
1. Identify key processes your organization needs
2. Design protocols for each process
3. Ensure protocols align with your values and structure
4. Test protocols with your group
5. Refine based on feedback and experience

### Phase 4: Implementation and Iteration (Ongoing)
1. Begin using the constitution in practice
2. Document lessons learned
3. Regularly review and update based on experience
4. Evolve the constitution as your organization grows

## Customization Guidelines

### Organization-Specific Elements
- Replace `[Organization Name]` with your actual organization name
- Replace `[ORGANIZATION-ABBREVIATION]` with your organization's abbreviation
- Update all references to reflect your specific context
- Modify roles, membranes, and protocols to fit your needs

### Required Customizations
- **Identity**: Must be specific to your organization's purpose and values
- **Roles**: Should reflect the actual functions and responsibilities in your organization
- **Membranes**: Should match your organizational structure and needs
- **Protocols**: Must be practical and implementable by your group

### Optional Elements
- **Program Treasuries**: Only if you need separate funding for different activities
- **Complex Governance Structures**: Only if your organization requires them
- **Specialized Protocols**: Only if you have specific needs not covered by basic protocols

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Review protocol effectiveness and identify issues
- **Quarterly**: Assess role and membrane performance
- **Annually**: Comprehensive constitution review and update

### Amendment Process
1. Identify the need for change
2. Propose specific amendments
3. Review with relevant stakeholders
4. Implement changes through appropriate protocols
5. Update documentation and communicate changes

### Version Control
- Maintain version history of all changes
- Document rationale for significant changes
- Ensure all members have access to current versions
- Archive previous versions for reference

## Getting Help

### Resources
- Use the Identity Section Dialogue Survey for identity development
- Reference the Member Onboarding Guide for implementation
- Use provided templates for consistency
- Review examples in the main constitution for guidance

### Common Challenges
- **Consensus Building**: Focus on shared values and purpose
- **Complexity Management**: Start simple and add complexity as needed
- **Implementation**: Begin with core protocols and expand gradually
- **Maintenance**: Establish regular review processes early

## Next Steps

1. **Assemble your team** for constitution development
2. **Schedule identity workshops** using the dialogue survey
3. **Begin with identity documents** and build from there
4. **Test and iterate** as you implement
5. **Document your journey** for future reference
