## Instructions for Filling Out This Document

### What are Values?
Your values define what you stand for and how you expect to behave. They guide both personal conduct and system design decisions. Good values are:
- **Lived** - Actually practiced, not just stated
- **Clear** - Specific enough to guide behavior
- **Consistent** - Values that work together
- **Meaningful** - Important enough to defend

### How to Develop Your Values

1. **Identify what matters** - What principles are most important to you?
2. **Distinguish personal from systemic** - How do you behave vs. how do you design systems?
3. **Test for commitment** - Are you willing to defend these values?
4. **Consider trade-offs** - What would you sacrifice to uphold these values?
5. **Align with purpose** - Do these values support your core purpose?

### Key Questions to Answer
