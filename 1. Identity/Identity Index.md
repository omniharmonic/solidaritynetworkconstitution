# Identity Documents

The core meaning and intentionality of your organization â€” why it exists, what it serves, and how it stays oriented over time.

## Identity Development Process

### Step 1: Use the Dialogue Survey
Begin with the `Identity Section Dialogue Survey.md` to guide your group through exploring and defining each identity component.

### Step 2: Draft Each Document
Create each identity document using the templates provided. Work through them in this order:

1. **Vision** - Start with the future you want to create
2. **Purpose** - Define why you exist now
3. **Mission** - Specify what you do to fulfill your purpose
4. **Worldview** - Articulate your fundamental assumptions
5. **Mandates** - Identify your obligations
6. **Values** - Define what you stand for
7. **Pledge** - Create member commitments

### Step 3: Ensure Alignment
Review all documents together to ensure they align and support each other.

## Key Questions for Each Document

### Vision
- What world are you trying to create?
- What would success look like 20 years from now?
- Who would benefit from this vision?

### Purpose
- Why does your organization exist?
- What would be lost if you didn't exist?
- What unique role do you play?

### Mission
- What do you do to fulfill your purpose?
- What are your core activities and functions?
- How do your activities work together?

### Worldview
- What do you believe about how the world works?
- What assumptions guide your approach?
- What paradigm are you trying to shift?

### Mandates
- What are you obligated to do?
- What would be a betrayal of your purpose?
- What are your non-negotiables?

### Values
- What do you stand for?
- How do you expect members to behave?
- What ethical principles guide your work?

### Pledge
- What do members commit to when joining?
- What are the non-negotiable commitments?
- How do you renew your commitments?

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with the big picture** - Begin with Vision and Purpose
2. **Be specific** - Avoid vague language that could mean anything
3. **Test your language** - Would a new member understand this?
4. **Check for alignment** - Do all documents support each other?
5. **Keep it practical** - Can you use this to guide decisions?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Vague language** - "Make the world better" is too general
- **Inconsistent values** - Values that contradict each other
- **Unrealistic vision** - Vision that's impossible to achieve
- **Missing mandates** - No clear obligations or responsibilities
- **Weak pledge** - Commitments that don't mean anything

## Next Steps

After completing your identity documents:

1. **Review with stakeholders** - Get feedback from key people
2. **Test in practice** - Use your identity to guide real decisions
3. **Refine based on experience** - Update as you learn
4. **Move to Structure** - Design roles and membranes that support your identity
