# Identity Section Dialogue Survey

## Overview

This survey is designed to guide a group through collaborative exploration and definition of the Identity section of their constitution. The Identity section establishes the core meaning and intentionality of the organization â€” why it exists, what it serves, and how it stays oriented over time.

**Facilitation Notes:**
- Allow 2-3 hours for the complete survey
- Use breakout groups for some questions to encourage diverse perspectives
- Capture all responses for later synthesis
- Encourage storytelling and personal experiences
- Focus on consensus-building rather than voting

---

## Opening Reflection (15 minutes)

### 1. Personal Connection
**Individual reflection, then group sharing:**

*"Think about a time when you felt most alive, engaged, and purposeful in your work or community involvement. What was happening? What made it meaningful? How did it connect to something larger than yourself?"*

**Follow-up questions:**
- What patterns do you notice in people's stories?
- What common themes emerge about what drives meaningful engagement?
- How might these insights inform our organization's identity?

---

## Vision Exploration (30 minutes)

### 2. Future World
**Group discussion with visual mapping:**

*"Imagine it's 20 years from now, and our organization has been wildly successful. What does the world look like? What has changed? What problems have been solved? What new possibilities exist?"*

**Guiding questions:**
- What specific changes would you point to as evidence of success?
- Who are the primary beneficiaries of these changes?
- What systems or structures have been transformed?
- What would make you say "mission accomplished"?
- If this vision came true, would our organization still be needed?

### 3. Vision Clarity Check
**Small group exercise:**

*"In your group, try to describe our desired future world in one sentence. Then test it: Would this vision inspire someone to join our cause? Would it guide difficult decisions? Would it help us say 'no' to good opportunities that aren't quite right?"*

---

## Purpose Discovery (30 minutes)

### 4. Why We Exist
**Individual reflection, then group synthesis:**

*"Why does our organization exist? Not what we do, but why we do it. What is the fundamental reason we've come together? What would be lost if we didn't exist?"*

**Probing questions:**
- What unique role do we play that others don't?
- What would happen if we disappeared tomorrow?
- What draws people to our organization specifically?
- What keeps us going when things get difficult?

### 5. Purpose vs. Mission
**Group clarification:**

*"How is our purpose different from our mission? Our purpose is why we exist; our mission is what we do to fulfill that purpose. Can you distinguish between these?"*

**Examples to discuss:**
- Purpose: "To connect people" vs. Mission: "To build social networks"
- Purpose: "To heal communities" vs. Mission: "To provide mental health services"

---

## Mission Definition (25 minutes)

### 6. What We Do
**Group activity with sticky notes:**

*"What are the core activities, functions, or services that our organization provides? Write each one on a sticky note, then group them into themes."*

**Refinement questions:**
- Which of these are essential to our purpose?
- Which could we stop doing without losing our identity?
- What's missing from this list?
- How do these activities work together?

### 7. Mission Statement Crafting
**Collaborative writing:**

*"Based on our discussion, let's craft a clear, concise mission statement. It should be specific enough to guide decisions but broad enough to allow for evolution."*

**Criteria to test:**
- Can a new member understand what we do?
- Would this help us prioritize opportunities?
- Is it inspiring and clear?

---

## Worldview Exploration (25 minutes)

### 8. Our Assumptions
**Group discussion:**

*"What are the fundamental assumptions we hold about how the world works? What do we believe about human nature, change, collaboration, power, or systems?"*

**Areas to explore:**
- How do we think change happens?
- What do we believe about human potential?
- How do we view power and authority?
- What do we think about competition vs. collaboration?
- How do we understand the relationship between individuals and systems?

### 9. Paradigm Shift
**Reflection question:**

*"What paradigm or worldview are we trying to shift or challenge? What dominant assumptions are we working against?"*

---

## Values Identification (30 minutes)

### 10. Personal Ethics
**Individual reflection, then group synthesis:**

*"What personal qualities and behaviors do we expect from our members? What would make someone a good fit for our organization? What would make someone a poor fit?"*

**Categories to explore:**
- How do we treat each other?
- How do we handle conflict?
- How do we make decisions?
- How do we communicate?
- How do we hold each other accountable?

### 11. System Design Ethics
**Group discussion:**

*"When we design systems, processes, or interventions, what ethical principles guide us? What outcomes are we trying to create? What outcomes are we trying to avoid?"*

**Consider:**
- Who benefits from our work?
- How do we think about power and privilege?
- What do we believe about human agency?
- How do we balance individual and collective needs?
- What do we consider "success" in systemic terms?

### 12. Values Prioritization
**Group exercise:**

*"If we had to choose only 3-5 core values that define our organization, what would they be? Rank them in order of importance."*

**Test each value:**
- Would we still be us without this value?
- Does this value guide our behavior when things get difficult?
- Would we be willing to sacrifice other things to uphold this value?

---

## Mandates Clarification (20 minutes)

### 13. Our Obligations
**Group discussion:**

*"What are we obligated to do? What would be a betrayal of our purpose or values? What are the non-negotiables for our organization?"*

**Areas to explore:**
- What are our responsibilities to our members?
- What are our responsibilities to our communities?
- What are our responsibilities to future generations?
- What are our responsibilities to the natural world?
- What would we never do, even if it seemed expedient?

### 14. Mandate vs. Choice
**Clarification exercise:**

*"What are we mandated to do (obligated) versus what we choose to do (optional)? How do we distinguish between these?"*

---

## Integration and Synthesis (20 minutes)

### 15. Identity Coherence
**Group reflection:**

*"How do all these pieces fit together? Does our vision align with our purpose? Do our values support our mission? Are our mandates consistent with our worldview?"*

**Check for alignment:**
- Does our vision inspire our purpose?
- Does our purpose justify our mission?
- Do our values guide our mandates?
- Does our worldview support our values?

### 16. Identity Statement
**Collaborative drafting:**

*"Let's draft a brief identity statement that captures the essence of who we are. This should be something that could guide a new member's understanding of our organization."*

---

## Closing Reflection (15 minutes)

### 17. Personal Commitment
**Individual reflection:**

*"Given what we've defined today, what is your personal commitment to this organization? What are you willing to contribute? What do you need from others to fulfill this commitment?"*

### 18. Next Steps
**Group planning:**

*"What do we need to do next to bring this identity to life? How will we communicate this to our members? How will we use this to guide our decisions?"*

## Template for Identity Documents

Based on this dialogue, you'll want to create or refine these documents:

1. **Vision** - The world you seek to help create
2. **Purpose** - Why you exist now
3. **Mission** - What you do to fulfill your purpose
4. **Worldview** - Your fundamental assumptions about how the world works
5. **Mandates** - What you are obligated to do
6. **Values** - What you stand for (personal and system design ethics)
7. **Pledge** - What members commit to when joining

Each document should be clear, inspiring, and actionable enough to guide daily decisions and long-term strategy.
