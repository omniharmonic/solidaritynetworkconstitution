Your pledge is the foundational commitment that members make when joining your organization. It establishes the agreement between individual members and the collective organization. A good pledge is:
- **Meaningful** - Represents a real commitment

2. **Consider mutual obligations** - What does the organization promise in return?
3. **Make it meaningful** - Should represent a real commitment
4. **Keep it practical** - Should be achievable and sustainable
5. **Test for clarity** - Would a new member understand what they're committing to?

### Key Questions to Answer

- What do members promise when they join?
- What are the non-negotiable commitments?
- What do members expect from the organization?
- What happens if commitments aren't met?
