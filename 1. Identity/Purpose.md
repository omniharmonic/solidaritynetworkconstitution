1. **Ask "why" repeatedly** - Keep asking why until you get to the core reason
2. **Focus on being, not doing** - Purpose is about existence, not activities
3. **Think timeless** - This should remain true even if everything else changes
4. **Consider what you're drawn to** - What naturally attracts people to your organization?
5. **Test for coherence** - Does this hold your organization together?
