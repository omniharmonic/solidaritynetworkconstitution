## Instructions for Filling Out This Document

### What is a Worldview?
Your worldview consists of the fundamental assumptions you hold about how the world works. These assumptions shape how you understand problems, design solutions, and approach your work. A good worldview is:
- **Explicit** - Clearly stated and understood
- **Coherent** - Assumptions that work together
- **Practical** - Guides real decision-making
- **Evolving** - Open to learning and refinement

### How to Develop Your Worldview

1. **Surface your assumptions** - What do you take for granted about how things work?
2. **Question dominant paradigms** - What assumptions are you challenging?
3. **Consider multiple perspectives** - How do different worldviews see the same issues?
4. **Test your assumptions** - Are they supported by evidence and experience?
5. **Align with your values** - Do your assumptions support your ethical commitments?

### Key Questions to Answer

- How do you think change happens?
- What do you believe about human nature and potential?
- How do you view power and authority?
- What do you think about competition vs. collaboration?
- What paradigm or worldview are you trying to shift?

## Worldview Test

### Clarity Test
- Are your assumptions clearly stated?
- Can others understand your worldview?
- Is it explicit rather than implicit?

### Coherence Test
- Do your assumptions work together?
- Are there any contradictions?
- Do they support each other?

### Practical Test

## Example Worldview (for reference)

*"We believe that change happens through the emergence of new patterns and practices that spread through networks of aligned agents. We see humans as inherently creative, collaborative, and capable of self-organization when given the right conditions. We understand power as distributed and best exercised through participatory processes that respect individual agency while enabling collective action. We believe that collaboration and cooperation are more effective than competition for addressing complex systemic challenges."*
