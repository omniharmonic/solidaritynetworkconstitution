# Membranes

Organizational units or "circles" for different functions within the organization.

## Membrane Development Process

### Step 1: Identify Organizational Functions
Based on your mission and purpose, identify the core functions your organization needs to fulfill.

### Step 2: Group Related Functions
Group related functions together to create logical organizational units.

### Step 3: Define Membrane Boundaries
Clearly define what each membrane is responsible for and how it relates to other membranes.

### Step 4: Assign Roles and Assets
Identify which roles belong to each membrane and what assets they manage.

### Step 5: Establish Relationships
Define how membranes relate to each other and coordinate their work.

### Step 6: Test and Refine
Ensure membranes are practical, clear, and aligned with your identity.

## Membrane Categories

### Governance Membranes
Membranes responsible for organizational governance, decision-making, and strategic direction.

### Support Membranes
Membranes that provide support services to other membranes and the organization.

## Membrane Design Principles

### Clear Purpose
- Each membrane should have a clear, specific purpose
- Purpose should align with organizational mission
- Boundaries should be well-defined

### Appropriate Scope
- Membrane scope should be manageable and focused
- Responsibilities should be clearly defined
- Overlap with other membranes should be minimized

### Effective Coordination
- Membranes should coordinate effectively with each other
- Communication channels should be clear
- Decision-making processes should be well-defined

### Flexible Adaptation
- Membranes should be able to adapt to changing needs
- Structure should support learning and evolution
- Boundaries should be permeable when appropriate

## Key Questions for Membrane Design

### Function Analysis
- What functions does this membrane need to fulfill?
- What activities are essential to this membrane?
- What capabilities does this membrane need?

### Boundary Definition
- What is this membrane responsible for?
- What is outside this membrane's scope?
- How does this membrane relate to other membranes?

### Role Assignment
- What roles belong to this membrane?
- How do roles work together within this membrane?
- What leadership or coordination is needed?

### Asset Management
- What assets does this membrane manage?
- How are assets allocated and used?
- What resources does this membrane need?

## Membrane Template Structure

Each membrane should include:

### Basic Information
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the membrane
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Description**: Brief description of the membrane's purpose
- **Parent Membrane**: Which membrane this belongs to (if any)

### Membrane Details
- **Related Roles**: Which roles belong to this membrane
- **Related Assets**: What assets this membrane manages
- **Related Protocols**: What processes govern this membrane

### Functions and Responsibilities
- **Key Functions**: Main activities and responsibilities
- **Decision-Making**: How decisions are made within this membrane
- **Coordination**: How this membrane works with others

## Membrane Testing

### Purpose Test
- Does this membrane have a clear, specific purpose?
- Is the purpose aligned with your mission?
- Are the boundaries well-defined?

### Functionality Test
- Does this membrane fulfill necessary functions?
- Can the membrane operate effectively?
- Are the responsibilities achievable?

### Coordination Test
- Does this membrane coordinate well with others?
- Are communication channels clear?
- Are decision-making processes effective?

### Practicality Test
- Is this membrane practical and implementable?
- Do you have people who can fulfill these roles?
- Are the requirements realistic?

## Common Membrane Patterns

### Council-Based Governance
- Multiple councils for different governance functions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Collaborative decision-making

### Program-Based Organization
- Programs organized around specific activities
- Cross-functional coordination
- Specialized expertise and focus

### Functional Organization
- Functions organized by type of work
- Clear specialization
- Efficient resource allocation

### Hybrid Approaches
- Combining multiple patterns
- Adapting structure to specific needs
- Balancing centralization and decentralization

## Next Steps

After designing your membranes:

1. **Create individual membrane documents** using the membrane template
2. **Define membrane relationships** and update role documents
3. **Develop membrane protocols** for coordination and decision-making
4. **Test membranes in practice** with real activities
5. **Refine based on experience** and feedback
