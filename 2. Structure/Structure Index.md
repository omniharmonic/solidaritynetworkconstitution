# Structure

The organizational architecture that supports your identity and enables effective governance.

## Structure Development Process

### Step 1: Understand Your Identity
Before designing structure, ensure you have a clear understanding of your organization's identity (Vision, Purpose, Mission, Values, etc.).

### Step 2: Identify Core Functions
Based on your mission and purpose, identify the core functions your organization needs to fulfill.

### Step 3: Design Roles
Create roles that support these functions, ensuring each role has clear responsibilities and permissions.

### Step 4: Create Membranes
Group related roles into membranes (organizational units) that work together to fulfill specific functions.

### Step 5: Define Assets
Identify the resources, tools, and information your organization needs to manage.

### Step 6: Ensure Alignment
Review the structure to ensure it supports your identity and enables effective governance.

## Structure Components

### Roles
Defined positions with specific rights and responsibilities.

### Membranes
Organizational units or "circles" for different functions.

### Assets
Resources, tools, and information managed by the organization.

## Key Questions for Structure Design

### Function Analysis
- What core functions does your organization need to fulfill?
- What activities are essential to your mission?
- What capabilities do you need to develop?

### Role Design
- What roles are needed to fulfill these functions?
- What are the responsibilities and permissions for each role?
- How do roles relate to each other?

### Membrane Organization
- How should roles be grouped into organizational units?
- What is the relationship between different membranes?
- How do membranes coordinate with each other?

### Asset Management
- What resources does your organization need?
- How should assets be managed and allocated?
- What information and tools are essential?

## Structure Design Principles

### Alignment with Identity
- Structure should support your purpose and mission
- Roles and membranes should reflect your values
- Governance should enable your vision

### Clarity and Simplicity
- Each role should have clear responsibilities
- Relationships between components should be obvious
- Structure should be easy to understand and navigate

### Flexibility and Adaptability
- Structure should allow for growth and change
- Roles and membranes should be able to evolve
- Governance should support learning and adaptation

### Effectiveness and Efficiency
- Structure should enable effective decision-making
- Roles should minimize duplication and conflict
- Processes should be streamlined and practical

## Common Structure Patterns

### Council-Based Governance
- Multiple councils for different functions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Collaborative decision-making

### Program-Based Organization
- Programs organized around specific activities
- Cross-functional coordination
- Specialized expertise and focus

### Network-Based Structure
- Distributed leadership and decision-making
- Flexible participation and engagement
- Emergent coordination and collaboration

### Hybrid Approaches
- Combining multiple patterns
- Adapting structure to specific needs
- Balancing centralization and decentralization

## Structure Testing

### Functionality Test
- Does the structure enable all necessary functions?
- Can the organization fulfill its mission effectively?
- Are there any gaps or missing capabilities?

### Clarity Test
- Is the structure clear and easy to understand?
- Do people know their roles and responsibilities?
- Are relationships between components obvious?

### Alignment Test
- Does the structure support your identity?
- Are roles and membranes consistent with your values?
- Does governance enable your vision?

### Practicality Test
- Is the structure practical and implementable?
- Can people actually fulfill their roles?
- Are processes efficient and effective?

## Next Steps

After designing your structure:

1. **Review with stakeholders** - Get feedback from key people
2. **Test in practice** - Try out the structure with real activities
3. **Refine based on experience** - Update as you learn
4. **Develop protocols** - Create processes that support the structure
5. **Document and communicate** - Ensure everyone understands the structure
